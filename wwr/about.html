            <h2> History</h2>
            <p>Wireframe Rafting was founded in 1995 by John and Mary Smith. They had a passion for whitewater
                rafting and wanted to share that passion with others. They started the business with just one
                raft and a dream. Over the years, Wireframe Rafting has grown into one of the premier whitewater
                rafting companies in the country. We now have a fleet of rafts and a team of experienced guides
                who are dedicated to providing our guests with an unforgettable experience. We are committed to
                safety and customer satisfaction, and we strive to make every trip down the river a memorable one.</p>
